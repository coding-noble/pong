# Overview

I developed a game called Pong in Unreal Engine 5 with the primary goal of learning basic game development. Pong is a classic arcade game that I chose to recreate as it serves as an excellent starting point for understanding game mechanics and Unreal Engine.

In Pong, a player controls paddles on the screen while an AI contoled computer contoles the other. The objective is to bounce a ball back and forth between the paddles, trying to outmaneuver your opponent and score points. The game is simple to play, as each player can move their paddle up and down to intercept the ball.

My purpose for writing this software was to gain hands-on experience in game development, especially within Unreal Engine 5. By programming Pong, I aimed to build a solid foundation in game mechanics, physics, object collision, and much more. This project allowed me to learn how to create a functional, interactive game, which is an essential skill for a software engineer aspiring to delve into the world of game development.

# Future Work

There is a lot of things that could be imporved on my game.

* Creat a UI for the user to start the level when ready
* Add colors and themes to make the game more visualy apealing
* Implament harder AI's for the computer
* Add background music.
